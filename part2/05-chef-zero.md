chef-zero
---------

So we have a working _disposable_ vm with with Vagrant now? 

Great, let's actually start playing with Chef.  

We're going to start with [chef-zero][cz] (or chef-client that uses a local server), 
which, believe it or not, can cover 75-85% of the use cases of Chef. 
Keep this in mind as you go through this book, because if it fits there may be
no need to go farther.

Since we installed the chef-dk during our vm-setup, we already have the 
chef-client with chef-zero.

Restart your Vagrant box with `vagrant up` if you have stopped or destroyed it. 
Type these following commands in to confirm we are set up correctly.

Let's run chef-zero:

```bash
[~/vagrant/chef-book] % vagrant ssh

SSL validation of HTTPS requests is disabled. HTTPS connections are still
encrypted, but chef is not able to detect forged replies or man in the middle
attacks.

To fix this issue add an entry like this to your configuration file:

  # Verify all HTTPS connections (recommended)
  ssl_verify_mode :verify_peer

  # OR, Verify only connections to chef-server
  verify_api_cert true

To check your SSL configuration, or troubleshoot errors, you can use the
`knife ssl check` command like so:

  knife ssl check -c

A few complaints about SSL, but other than that... nothing really happened. 
Chef, uses a compiled top down set of instructions, or _recipes_, 
to build a machine how 
you want it to be. You can see that this process starts with 
the `Compiling Cookbooks...` line.  But there's nothing to compile.

Let's take a minute to silence those SSL warnings. Since we're working locally
with throwaway VMs, we can tell Chef to only use SSL when communicating with
their hosted API. We do this by creating a configuration file used by chef-zero:

```bash
vagrant@chef-book:~$ mkdir -p ~/.chef
vagrant@chef-book:~$ vim ~/.chef/knife.rb
```

and add the following line:

```ruby
verify_api_cert true
```

Re-run chef-client and the SSL warnings should be gone.

```bash
vagrant@chef-book:~$ sudo chef-client -z
[2014-06-28T12:42:31-07:00] WARN: No cookbooks directory found at or above current directory.  Assuming /root.

Now let's go on to actually making Chef do something!
