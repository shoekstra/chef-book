knife
=====

Ok, believe it or not, you're a chef now. You can create simple (but extremely useful) recipes to get provisioning done. You may have even started to pull down cookbooks from the [community](http://community.opscode.com/) and started playing around with them. The next step is the main tool of all chefs: [knife](http://docs.opscode.com/knife.html). 
Before we go any further, there is a quote that you always need to keep in your head (I'm paraphrasing it as best I can here):
> Every chef should have a knife, it'll be your best friend, you'll use it constantly, but always remember it'll cut you in a heart beat.

Please take that to heart; I have many times screwed up a `knife` command and caused significant pain.

So let's make sure you have knife. Initally we'll start in the chef-book vm, and move on from there. Type the following:

```bash
root@chef-book:~# knife
ERROR: You need to pass a sub-command (e.g., knife SUB-COMMAND)

Holy crap that's a lot of stuff. I'm not going to go through each and every one, but if you saw it, then you're ready to start. If not...well you might want to confirm Chef is installed correctly on your VM.

knife.rb
-------

The [knife.rb](http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_knife.html) file is the configuration file for using `knife`. Apropos, right? Lets start setting one up. If you clicked on the link you'll see that there are a good number of options, but we'll go through the basic configurations you should set. By the way, let's start doing this in the chef-book VM, but you could easily do the same configuration on a Mac/Linux box too.

```bash
root@chef-book:~# mkdir .chef
root@chef-book:~# touch .chef/knife.rb
root@chef-book:~# vim .chef/knife.rb
```

```ruby
log_level                :info
log_location             STDOUT
node_name                'chef-book'
client_key               '/etc/chef/chef-book.pem'
validation_client_name   'chef-validator'
validation_key           '/etc/chef/chef-validator.pem'
chef_server_url          'https://awesomechef-server.at.some.domain.com'
cookbook_path            ["~/cookbooks"]
cache_type               'BasicFile'
cookbook_copyright       "My company that want's the copyright"
cookbook_license         "apachev2"
cookbook_email           "jj.asghar@peopleadmin.com"
```

So this is just an example, but it will be useful when we move on to the chef-server and knife plugins. The most important of these are probably `log_level` (how much data you want to see), `log_location` (where to log it), `cookbook_path` (the path to your cookbooks), and the `cookbook_[copyright|licence|email]` (because if you fill them out here you won't need to do it for `knife cookbook create`).

So let's talk about `knife cookbook create`. Originally you created a simple cookbook by making the directories and adding the files manually. Good ol' `knife` creates that foundation for you. As an example:

```bash
root@chef-book:~# mkdir cookbooks
root@chef-book:~# cd cookbooks/
root@chef-book:~/cookbooks# knife cookbook create new_cookbook
** Creating cookbook new_cookbook
** Creating README for cookbook: new_cookbook
** Creating CHANGELOG for cookbook: new_cookbook
** Creating metadata for cookbook: new_cookbook
root@chef-book:~/cookbooks# find new_cookbook/
new_cookbook/
new_cookbook/recipes
new_cookbook/recipes/default.rb
new_cookbook/definitions
new_cookbook/README.md
new_cookbook/CHANGELOG.md
new_cookbook/attributes
new_cookbook/files
new_cookbook/files/default
new_cookbook/providers
new_cookbook/metadata.rb
new_cookbook/resources
new_cookbook/libraries
new_cookbook/templates
new_cookbook/templates/default
root@chef-book:~/cookbooks#
```

As you can see, you have your `recipes/default.rb` and your `files/default/` directory. Laziness wins out! Oh, I should mention you didn't have to run `knife cookbook create new_cookbook` from the `~/cookbooks` directory (since we set the `cookbook_path` in our `knife.rb`). I just did it so I could run `find new_cookbook/` for the demonstration.

Ok, let's move on to [knife-plugins](09-knife-plugins.md). `knife` is designed to interact with something while provisioning, so let's pick up some plugins.
